Bell State Project
This project demonstrates how to create and analyze Bell states using quantum circuits with Qiskit. Bell states are special pairs of entangled qubits, which are fundamental in quantum computing and quantum information.

Features
Builds all four Bell states: |Φ+⟩, |Φ-⟩, |Ψ+⟩, |Ψ-⟩
Simulates quantum circuits using Qiskit and AerSimulator
Visualizes quantum states and measurement results
Compares ideal simulation results with real quantum hardware (IBM Quantum)
Bell States
|Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2
|Φ-⟩ = (|00⟩ - |11⟩) / √2
|Ψ+⟩ = (|01⟩ + |10⟩) / √2
|Ψ-⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩) / √2
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Qiskit
Matplotlib
Seaborn
IBM Quantum account (optional, for hardware runs)
